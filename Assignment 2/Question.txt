Implement four queens problem using local search(Hill climbing /gradient descent)
algorithm using use evaluation function as number of pairs of mean attacking each other.
Run your program for at least 20 times and each time note the value of
local minimum returned by your program. Take the snapshot of at least
one run if you get a global minimum.
Plot a graph of the results showing how many times your things to values}
Innovation:
Generalised Solution
Continuing Program for more iteration even after receiving a local minima
